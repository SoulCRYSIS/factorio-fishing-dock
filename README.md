## How it work

Just place the dock on water edges (just like asteroid collector), a fishing boat will automatic spawn and start to collect fish around (base on recipe selected).

The fishing dock is act like spawner, it will try to spawn fish everytime a craft succeeds. It can only spawn on to specific tiles (every nauvis water tiles for normal fish), so the more water, the more chance it will spawn (maximum at 100% when all tiles are water).
